IMPORTANT: This stylesheet is designed for learning and includes comments for guidance. It's a good idea to remove the comments when preparing your them for distribution. However, keep the section headers (the word "Reset" below is an example of a section header) intact.

Resetting and rebuilding styles have been helped along thanks to the fine work of Eric Meyer http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/index.html

/* =Responsive Structures

	#content,
	#primary,
	#secondary,
	#tertiary { /* Remove floats on all structural elements for smaller screens */
		float: none;

		padding: 0;

}


/* =IE Styling
----------------------------------------------- */

/* If you have any IE-specific adjustments to make, add them here.

For example:

#ie8 body {
	color #333;
}

Will make the sbody text #333 on IE8 only. In order for this to work, you need to set up conditionals to add an ID-selector to the HTML element when IE is detected. For instructions on how to set up the conditionals, see: http://themeshaper.com/2012/10/31/the-wordpress-theme-header-template/
