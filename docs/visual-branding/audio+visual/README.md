#TYPOGRAPHY
This is where you would keep documents with your brand voice overview, including words and phrases you commonly use and any guidelines for the language used. Then a copy bank file, which is where you can dump any phrases, quotes or sentences that you feel suits your brand and you may want to use or appropriate in your brand copy. You may also want a folder for final branding copy, such as mission statement, official bio, interview bio, about page text or brand video script.

#VISUAL BRANDING
    *Guides* - ie, Style Guide
    *Fonts* - Store all your brand fonts here. Even though you likely have them installed on your computer, it is good to keep a copy in your fonts in a set brand folder, to make it easy to share or change computers. These files do not need to follow the naming convention but can keep just the font name. You may want to have two folders in this folder, one for web fonts and one for desktop.
    *Logo* - 2 sub folders:
      Primary Logo
      Submarks
      * Keep folders in each for final files and working files/proofs.*
      For the logo need to have:
        Full Color Primary Logo in .jpg, .png, .pdf and .eps- Black only Primary Logo in .jpg, .png, .pdf and .eps- White only Primary Logo in .jpg, .png, .pdf and .epsYou need the same formats for each submark or logo variation in the submark folder.
    *Patterns*
    *Elements*
      miscellaneous brand elements that are used in your brand graphics, such as textures, borders, dividers, fancy bullet points, hand signatures, illustrations and any other little details that are used in your graphics. If you created any of these yourself be sure to again separate working files from final files. If you have elements that are created for very specific purposes, and not for use on a variety of applications, you may want to set them aside in a special folder, so there is no confusion about their usage.
    *Colour Palette*
        While your hex codes and Pantone and CMYK values should all be in your guidelines folder, you may also have palette files set up for easy colour palette set up, such as .ase and .clr. You may also want a file with colour chips as. such, if you use Pantones, with the exact Pantone colours in boxes on illustrator, for easy printer reference.
    *Icons* - 3 sub folders:
      () Social Media Icons
      () Website Icons

LEGAL FOLDER
ow you may want Legal folders within other folders to hold the legal documents related to that topic or you could keep them all in this one folder. Whatever makes more sense to you. Or you could always do both, so it is always easy to find. This would include all your website legal documents such as Terms and Conditions, as well as any licenses for fonts, stock images or audio. Having well-organised documents means you quickly have proof of your rights and can double check at any time the terms of use of the brand elements you have purchased.
